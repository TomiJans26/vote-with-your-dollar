## 🔥 DEPLOY NOW (code written, not live yet)
- [ ] Push Feb 21-22 frontend changes to Vercel (production)
- [ ] Deploy backend_v2 (FastAPI) to Railway
- [ ] Verify live site works with new UI + data
- [ ] Save FEC API key to env (not hardcoded)

---

## 🟡 BUILD PHASE (~30% of total work)
- [ ] Barcode scanning — smooth, reliable, fast
- [ ] Product alternatives engine ("you buy X, try Y instead")
- [ ] Affiliate links wired up and generating clicks
- [ ] Chrome browser extension (huge for user acquisition)
- [ ] Mobile PWA polish (feels like a real app, not a website)
- [ ] Shopping list feature (Dave's killer idea — curated lists)
- [ ] Report cards / alignment scores (weekly/monthly emails)
- [ ] FEC batch PAC lookup — re-run with real API key (had bugs)
- [ ] Search: "Is [brand] ethical?" landing pages

---

## 🔴 DATA PHASE (~25% of total work)
- [ ] Expand to 500+ companies with full issue coverage
- [ ] All 22 issues researched per company
- [ ] Automated data pipeline (Scout crawling news + press releases, not manual)
- [ ] Source citations for every claim (trust = everything)
- [ ] Data freshness — companies change positions, need update cycle
- [ ] Fill gaps: many companies missing PAC data (foreign, private, no PAC)

---

## 🔴 GROWTH PHASE (~25% of total work)
- [ ] SEO pages ranking on Google ("Is [brand] ethical?")
- [ ] Marketing content: TikTok ("I scanned my fridge"), Reddit, Instagram
- [ ] First 1,000 users
- [ ] First revenue from affiliate links
- [ ] Value-based click partnerships (brands pay per click on genuine recommendations)
- [ ] Press: "Spokane startup helps consumers vote with their wallets"
- [ ] Subreddits: r/ethicalconsumer, r/anticonsumption, r/politics

---

## 🔴 SCALE PHASE (~10% of total work)
- [ ] International expansion (UK, Canada, Australia first — see GLOBAL-ROADMAP.md)
- [ ] API for third-party integrations
- [ ] Team beyond Dave + Tomi
- [ ] Country-specific political donation databases

---

## 🔧 INFRA / HOUSEKEEPING
- [ ] Fix gateway bind issue (169.254.x APIPA adapter vs 192.168.2.101)
- [ ] Brave Search API — need paid plan for Scout research crawling
- [ ] Scout research pipeline: news + press releases (social media auth walls killed scraping)

---

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React + Vite (Vercel, free tier)
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Railway, $5/mo)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL on Railway (prod) / MSSQL SQL Server 2025 Express local (dev)
- **Local Dev DB:** Instance .\SQLEXPRESS01, database DollarVote
- **Domain:** dollarvote.app via GoDaddy (A record → 76.76.21.21)

---

## Business Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- **NO ADS. EVER.** No banners, pre-rolls, pop-ups. Not now, not when we're big. FOREVER.
- **Integrity first. Revenue second. Always.**
- Alignment scores are NEVER influenced by affiliate revenue
- We recommend what matches the user's values, period
- Revenue = affiliate links + value-based clicks (matchmaking, not advertising)
- All political donation data is public (FEC) — First Amendment protected, WA anti-SLAPP law
