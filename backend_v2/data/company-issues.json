After workers rejected a tentative agreement, Kellogg's management announced they would seek to replace all 1,400 striking workers â€” a direct threat to workers' fundamental right to strike. The strike lasted 77 days before resolution on December 21, 2021. This is one of the most aggressive anti-labor corporate actions of recent years in the US consumer goods sector."
