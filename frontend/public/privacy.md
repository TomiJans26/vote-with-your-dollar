# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date: February 15, 2026**

DollarVote ("we," "us," "our") respects your privacy. This policy explains what we collect, why, and what we do (and don't do) with your data.

**The short version:** We collect the minimum needed to run the app. We don't sell your data. Ever.

## What We Collect

When you create an account, we store:

- **Email address** — for account recovery and important notifications
- **Username** — your display name in the app
- **Password** — stored as a secure hash (we never see or store your actual password)
- **Belief profile** — the values and priorities you set during onboarding
- **Scan history** — products you've scanned (so you can review them later)

## What We Don't Collect

- No location data
- No contacts
- No device identifiers or advertising IDs
- No analytics or tracking (seriously — we have zero analytics tools installed)

## We Never Sell Your Data

Your personal data is **never sold, rented, or traded** to anyone. Period. This includes your belief profile, scan history, email, and any other information.

## Third-Party Services

DollarVote connects to these external services to function:

- **Open Food Facts API** — to look up product information from barcodes. When you scan a barcode, the UPC is sent to their API. See [Open Food Facts privacy policy](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/privacy).
- **FEC API** — to retrieve public political donation records. No personal data is sent; we only query public donor/committee data.

We do not share your personal information with either service. Only barcode numbers and public query terms are transmitted.

## Cookies & Local Storage

- **JWT authentication token** — stored locally to keep you signed in. That's it.
- No tracking cookies
- No third-party cookies
- No advertising cookies

## Data Retention

Your data is kept **as long as your account exists**. When you delete your account, all associated data (email, username, belief profile, scan history) is permanently deleted from our servers.

## Your Rights

You can:

- **View your data** — your profile and history are visible in the app
- **Update your data** — change your beliefs, email, or username anytime
- **Delete everything** — delete your account and all associated data from Settings

We aim to process deletion requests immediately. No hoops to jump through.

## Children's Privacy (COPPA)

DollarVote is **not intended for children under 13**. We do not knowingly collect data from anyone under 13. If we learn that a child under 13 has created an account, we will delete it promptly.

If you believe a child under 13 is using DollarVote, please contact us at **legal@dollarvote.app**.

## Security

We use industry-standard practices to protect your data:

- Passwords are hashed using secure algorithms (never stored in plain text)
- Authentication uses JWT tokens over HTTPS
- Database access is restricted and encrypted

No system is 100% secure, but we take reasonable steps to protect your information.

## Changes to This Policy

If we make meaningful changes to this policy, we'll notify you through the app before they take effect. Continued use after changes means you accept the updated policy.
