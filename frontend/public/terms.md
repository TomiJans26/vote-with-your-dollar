# Terms of Service

**Effective Date: February 15, 2026**

Welcome to DollarVote ("we," "us," "our"). By using dollarvote.app, you agree to these terms. If you don't agree, please don't use the service.

## What DollarVote Does

DollarVote lets you scan product barcodes, view information about parent company political donations sourced from public records (like FEC filings and news), and discover alternative products that may better align with your values.

## This Is Not Advice

DollarVote provides **educational and informational content only**. Nothing on this platform constitutes:

- Legal advice
- Financial advice
- Political advice or endorsement
- A recommendation to buy or boycott any specific product

Your purchasing decisions are entirely your own. We are not responsible for any decisions you make based on information shown in the app.

## Data Accuracy

We pull data from public sources including the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and public news reporting. While we do our best to keep information current and accurate:

- **We do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of any data.**
- Corporate structures change. Donation records get updated. News evolves.
- If you spot an error, please let us know — but understand that some lag is inevitable.

## "As Is" — No Warranty

DollarVote is provided **"as is" and "as available"** without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.

We don't guarantee the service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or secure at all times.

## Affiliate Commissions

When we recommend alternative products, some of those recommendations may include affiliate links. This means **we may earn a small commission** if you purchase through those links — at no extra cost to you.

We believe in transparency: affiliate relationships will never influence which companies are flagged or how donation data is presented.

## Your Account

- You must be **at least 13 years old** to create an account.
- You're responsible for keeping your login credentials secure.
- Don't share your account or let others use it.

## Your Content & Privacy

Your belief profile and scan history are **private to you**. We don't share, sell, or expose your personal values data. See our [Privacy Policy](/privacy) for full details.

## We Can Terminate Accounts

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that:

- Violate these terms
- Abuse the service (e.g., scraping, automated access, harassment)
- Are used for any unlawful purpose

We can also discontinue the service at any time, with reasonable notice when possible.

## Limitation of Liability

**To the maximum extent permitted by law**, DollarVote, its owner, and its contributors shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or data, arising from your use of the service.

Our total liability for any claim related to the service is limited to the amount you paid us in the 12 months before the claim (which, for a free service, is $0).

## Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless DollarVote, its owner (David Jansson), and any contributors from any claims, damages, losses, or expenses (including reasonable attorney fees) arising from:

- Your use of the service
- Your violation of these terms
- Any claim that your actions caused harm to a third party

## Anti-SLAPP Protection

DollarVote presents publicly available information about political donations — this is protected speech. We reserve all rights under Washington State's anti-SLAPP statute (RCW 4.24.525) and any applicable federal protections against strategic lawsuits intended to silence public participation.

## Governing Law

These terms are governed by the laws of the **State of Washington**, without regard to conflict of law principles. Any disputes will be resolved in the courts of Spokane County, Washington.

## Changes to These Terms

We may update these terms from time to time. If we make significant changes, we'll notify you through the app. Continued use after changes means you accept the new terms.
